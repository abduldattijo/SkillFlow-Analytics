3. AI insights for career path recommendations and skill correlations
4. Interactive visualizations like network graphs
5. Market intelligence features

Can you help me design the architecture and create a modern, professional interface using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS?
```

### Prompt 2: Technical Architecture
```
For the SkillFlow Analytics platform, I need:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Torre.ai API integration
- AI-powered analytics engine
- Interactive data visualizations
- Demo mode with realistic fake data

Please create the complete project structure with all necessary files and components.
```
